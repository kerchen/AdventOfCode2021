# AdventOfCode2021
My solutions for the 2021 Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/2021

I'm (mostly) holding myself to these standards:
- Use TDD to drive the implementation.
- Submit the correct answer on the first try (TDD definitely helps!) 
- Commit the code I had at the time I submitted the correct answer. I might go back and clean up later, but any crimes I commit for the sake of improving my ranking will forever haunt me.
